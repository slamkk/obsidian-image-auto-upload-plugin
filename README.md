# Obsidian Image Auto Upload Plugin

This plugin can help you to auto upload image by
[PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo)
[PicGo-Core](https://picgo.github.io/PicGo-Core-Doc/)
[PicList](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/PicList)

**You should restart obsidian after updating the plugin.**

# Start

1. install the [picgo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo) and config it
2. open the tool and open the setting "设置 server"
3. install the plugin in obsidian
4. open the plugin setting, and set the "picGo server" `http://127.0.0.1:{{port in picgo}}/upload`（example：`http://127.0.0.1:36677/upload`）
5. try paste image

## Set picbed and configName

If you are using PicList (version >= 2.5.3), you can set the picbed and configName through url parameters.
example: `http://127.0.0.1:36677/upload?picbed=smms&configName=piclist`
This will upload the image to the smms picbed and use the piclist configName.
Use this feature, you can upload image to different picbeds in different vaults.

# Features
